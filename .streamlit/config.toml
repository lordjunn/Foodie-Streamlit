# Theme is left unset so users can toggle Light / Dark / System
# via the built-in menu (☰ → Settings → Theme).
#
# To use a custom theme instead, uncomment below (replaces the toggle):
# [theme]
# base = "light"
# primaryColor = "#FF6B6B"
# backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
# secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F5F5F5"
# textColor = "#262730"
# font = "sans serif"
