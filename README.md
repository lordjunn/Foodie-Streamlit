# 🍜 Junn Food Log Scraper & Data Science Explorer

A full-featured **Streamlit** web application that scrapes, cleans, explores, and forecasts personal food spending data.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://junn-foodie-data-science.streamlit.app/)

## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Dashboard
- Hero KPI metrics — total meals, total spend, average price, unique restaurants, date range
- Monthly spending trend (bar + line overlay)
- Top 10 restaurants and dishes (horizontal bar charts)
- Day-of-week distribution and meal type pie chart
- Personal records — most expensive, cheapest, most visited, most ordered

### 📋 Data Explorer
- Interactive filters: restaurant, meal type, date range, dish name search
- Toggle to ignore zero / near-zero prices
- CSV export of filtered data
- Statistical summaries per meal category (mean, median, variance, std dev, etc.)
- Monthly KPI breakdown with colour-coded deltas (Δ Avg, % Change)
- LOWESS monthly summaries by meal type
- Monthly KPI breakdown by meal type

### 📈 Visualizations
- Box plot of price by meal category
- QQ plot for normality check
- Price distribution histogram with normal curve overlay
- Prices over time (scatter + LOWESS trendlines by meal type)
- Eating habits heatmap (meal frequency intensity)

### 🔮 Forecasting
- **Prophet** — trend-only, robust to missing data
- **Linear Regression** — simple time-index trend extrapolation
- **Exponential Smoothing** — Holt-Winters additive trend
- **ARIMA** — autoregressive integrated moving average
- Model comparison chart with confidence intervals
- Individual model drill-down with forecast tables

### 🔄 Month-to-Month Comparison
- Select any two months and compare side-by-side
- KPI deltas: avg price, total meals, total spend, unique restaurants
- Overlaid price distribution histograms
- Top restaurants comparison
- Meal type pie chart comparison

### 🍽️ Food Gallery
- Three view modes: All Dishes (card grid), By Dish (evolution), By Restaurant (list)
- Sorting: date, price, alphabetical
- Pagination (24 per page)
- Optional price trend overlay (top 15 most ordered)
- Default fallback image is shown whenever a dish has no image URL

### 💾 Persistent Data Cache (SQLite)
- App now loads from local SQLite DB first (`food_log_cache.db`)
- If DB already has data, scraping runs incrementally from the latest month in DB onward
- Example: if latest DB date is `2026-04-06`, scrape will only target `Apr 26` (and later requested months), not earlier months
- If DB is empty, app auto-scrapes using default preloaded settings and then saves to DB
- In-memory Streamlit cache clear does not delete the SQLite DB

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Project restructure (separate `config.py`, `models/`, `services/`, `tests/`)
- [ ] Type hints throughout all modules
- [ ] Logging (replace silent `pass` / `continue` in scraper)
- [ ] Unit tests (pytest) for scraper, price parsing, forecasting
- [ ] CI/CD (GitHub Actions) — lint, test, deploy
- [ ] Automatic model selection with time-series cross-validation & leaderboard
- [ ] Anomaly detection (flag unusually expensive meals / price jumps)
- [ ] Pre-loaded CSV snapshot for instant demo
